# SuperSeedAndTheGreatOak
Superseed and the Great Oak is small game I made with my brother Isaac in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).
While scratch is amazing it's not a great game engine for full scale games. This project is a remake of the
original [Superseed and the Great Oak](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/608597457/).
